# complete-react-setup-using-scratch

This is a react boilerplate

Here's what each package does:

- react: UI library for creating modular components
- react-dom: enables us to render the React within the browser DOM
- @babel/core: a JavaScript transpiler to converts modern JavaScript into a production-ready version that's compatible with all browsers.
- @babel/preset-env: group of commonly used Babel plugins bundled into a preset that converts modern JavaScript features into widely compatible syntax
- @babel/preset-react: React-specific Babel plugins that convert JSX syntax into plain old JavaScript that browsers can understand
- babel-loader: connects Babel to webpack's build process
- css-loader: The css-loader interprets @import and url() like import/require() and will resolve them.
- html-webpack-plugin: an extension to webpack that adds the basic index html file
- style-loader: Inject CSS into the DOM.
- webpack: bundler that converts your source code into production-ready output
- webpack-cli: webpack CLI provides a flexible set of commands for developers to increase speed when setting up a custom webpack project. As of webpack v4, webpack is not expecting a configuration file, but often developers want to create a more custom webpack configuration based on their use-cases and needs. webpack CLI addresses these needs by providing a set of tools to improve the setup of custom webpack configuration.
- webpack-dev-server: transforms our source code and serves it on a web server as we develop it continuously. This helps use see the output of your code in the browser.
